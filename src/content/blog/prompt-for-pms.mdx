Here are general tips when prompting:

1. **Be Specific with Your Request:** Craft your prompts to be as precise as possible. Instead of broad questions, ask for specific insights. For example, "What user interface elements can improve accessibility for an app targeting visually impaired users?"
2. **Define the Context Clearly:** Provide the tool with enough background to understand the nuances of your product and market. For example, "Given the competitive landscape of the budget travel app market, what unique value propositions could set our product apart?"
3. **Use Open-Ended Questions for Ideation:** Encourage creativity by asking questions that allow for a range of ideas. For instance, "What are some cutting-edge features that we could explore for our health-tracking app to appeal to tech-savvy fitness enthusiasts?"
4. **Leverage the tools for Data Analysis:** Ask your LLM of choice to perform specific analysis tasks, such as "Analyze the following user engagement data to identify which features are most used by our customers in the age range 25-34."
5. **Prompt for Summarization:** When faced with large amounts of information, use an LLM to distill key points, e.g. "Summarize the feedback received from our beta test users for the new project management feature set."
