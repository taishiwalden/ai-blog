Certain generative AI tools, for example, ChatGPT, GPT-4, GitHub Co-Pilot, AWS CodeWhisperer, Google Bard, etc. can enhance productivity, assist in research, evaluate, and generate code, and aid in producing marketing and other materials. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to associates about the use of generative AI tools with Forum and our Clients.

## Guidance

Forum wants to embrace the use of generative AI tools and desires to utilize them both appropriately and securely. As a consulting firm, we must maintain the privacy and security of our client information and that of our Firm. Users of generative AI tools must:

1. Safeguard client intellectual property and confidential information,
2. Safeguard Forum confidential information,
3. Not include any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the generative AI tools,
4. Not plagiarize third-party content,
5. Adhere to any AI use guidelines in place at the client,
6. Use generative AI tools in an ethical manner and;
7. Use a generative AI tool that operates consistently with these guidelines

## Acceptable Use

Below are general guidelines for how to use generative AI tools:

* AI Platform Policies. In addition to the requirements of this guidance, associates should adhere to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, etc. provided by the generative AI software itself. These policies are crucial for understanding how to appropriately use and configure these platforms and should be reviewed by the associate before utilizing these platforms.
* Research. Generative AI tools may be used for research and general knowledge gathering. However, associates should review the information provided by such tools and validate its accuracy before incorporating AI content in any work product.
* Document/Email Drafting. Associates may use generative AI tools to craft initial drafts of documents, emails, policies, and templates supporting client work. However, before any of these documents are used internally or externally, the associate must review and revise such content to ensure quality control, avoid plagiarism, and ensure it is consistent with Forum and Client messaging protocols. The document produced should look like a Forum work product and evolve from the initial draft provided by the generative AI tool. In using generative AI tools for drafting purposes, associates may not insert confidential information.
* Images/Audio. Associates may use generative AI tools to develop images, designs, and audio to generate ideas for Forum provided that no PII, confidential information, third-party names, associate names, or Forum product images or audio are uploaded to or utilized within the generative AI tool.2 | P a g e January 2024
